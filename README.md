# Descover-the-planets-App---Android-Studio
 The project uses Android Studio's adapters for a ListView, along with CheckBoxes, RadioGroups, and RadioButtons. It displays a list of planets in sequence. When a user selects a planet, a new page opens, allowing them to access that planet's Wikipedia page (if "Yes" is selected) and view an image of the planet (if the CheckBox is checked).
